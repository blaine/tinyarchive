<p>Hi there! We've already checked {{url|escape}} once this week, so we're
  politely declining to do so again. If you'd like to try next week, please be
  our guest! In the meantime, you can check to see if {{url|escape}} exists in
  our records anywhere by checking <a href="/url?url={{url|escape}}">here</a>.</p>
