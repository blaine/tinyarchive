<p>tinyarchive.org is a publicly accessible archive of shortened URLs and their
  destinations over time.</p>

{% include "base_newurl.html" %}

<p class="text">What happens when you tinyarchive a URL is that a HEAD request is made to
the URL in question, and if the HTTP response code is 301 (permanent
redirect) or 302 (temporary redirect), then the shortened URL is stored along
with the target URL and time-stamped.</p>

<p class="text">At some point in the future, when tinyurl and bit.ly are lost to the annals,
you can check the annals (this site) and find out where a shortened URL used
to point, and go there. Or archive.org if the original site doesn't exist
anymore.</p>
